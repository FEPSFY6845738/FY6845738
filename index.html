       Quantum computers utilise the rules of quantum mechanics to perform tasks exponentially 
       faster than normal computers. They utilise a few fundamental principles of quantum 
       mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform highly complex tasks in a 
       short period of time. Quantum computers have the potential to transform several industries 
       such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, cryptography, drugs, and healthcare. Our 
       understanding of quantum computers is still in its early stages, with there being challenges 
       to face such as the stability of qubits however, researchers and large companies such as 
       Microsoft and Google are racing to grow their understanding of quantum computing to be 
       able to unlock their full potential and be able to fully utilise them. This article will explain
       more about what a quantum computer is and how it operates, the ideas of superposition 
       and entanglement, and the uses and the pros and cons of quantum computers.

        A quantum computer sounds like something from the future, but how do they work? 
        Quantum computers use principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and 
        entanglement along with qubits to perform quantum operations. But what do these mean? 
        A qubit (or quantum bit) is the quantum equivalent of a bit found in a classical computer. 
        The difference is that a classical computer uses bits which are a stream of electrical impulses 
        to represent a 1 or 0, on the other hand, quantum computers use qubits – usually sub-atomic 
        particles like photons (Giles, 2019). Qubits possess quantum properties such as 
        superposition and entanglement. 
        
        Superposition is the ability of a particle to be in multiple states at once until they are 
        observed (TechTarget Contributor, 2021). For qubits, this means that it can be both a 0 and a 
        1 at the same time until measured by the quantum gate, once observed, its quantum state 
        will instantly collapse to either the 1 or 0. The ability for a qubit to be in both states of 0 and 
        1 simultaneously means they can explore all possible solutions to a problem at the same 
        time, whereas bits have to go through each solution one by one (Linkedin.com, 2023). 
        Therefore, qubits allow quantum computers to solve problems millions of times faster than 
        classical computers. According to the research (Marr, 2021), Google announced it has a 
        quantum computer that is 100 million times faster than any classical computer in its lab.
        
        Quantum entanglement is a strange phenomenon that describes how two subatomic 
        particles are linked even if millions of light years apart (Emspak and Hickok, 2022). Qubits 
        are in a state of superposition before being measured, so they’re both 1 and 0 at the same 
        time. Having two entangled qubits, for example, q1 and q2, means that if we measure the 
        state of q1 to be 0, we know for definite that the state of q2 will be 1, without needing to 
        measure q2 (Madali Nabil, 2023). When two qubits are entangled, it also means that 
        changing the state of one qubit will instantaneously change the state of the other in a 
        predictable way, even if over very long distances (Giles, 2019). In a classical computer, 
        doubling the number of bits will double its processing power, but with quantum computers, 
        due to entanglement, slightly increasing the number of entangled qubits will exponentially 
        increase its processing speed (Giles, 2019).
