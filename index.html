       Quantum computers utilise the rules of quantum mechanics to perform tasks exponentially 
       faster than normal computers. They utilise a few fundamental principles of quantum 
       mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform highly complex tasks in a 
       short period of time. Quantum computers have the potential to transform several industries 
       such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, cryptography, drugs, and healthcare. Our 
       understanding of quantum computers is still in its early stages, with there being challenges 
       to face such as the stability of qubits however, researchers and large companies such as 
       Microsoft and Google are racing to grow their understanding of quantum computing to be 
       able to unlock their full potential and be able to fully utilise them. This article will explain
       more about what a quantum computer is and how it operates, the ideas of superposition 
       and entanglement, and the uses and the pros and cons of quantum computers.

        A quantum computer sounds like something from the future, but how do they work? 
        Quantum computers use principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and 
        entanglement along with qubits to perform quantum operations. But what do these mean? 
        A qubit (or quantum bit) is the quantum equivalent of a bit found in a classical computer. 
        The difference is that a classical computer uses bits which are a stream of electrical impulses 
        to represent a 1 or 0, on the other hand, quantum computers use qubits – usually sub-atomic 
        particles like photons (Giles, 2019). Qubits possess quantum properties such as 
        superposition and entanglement. 
        
        Superposition is the ability of a particle to be in multiple states at once until they are 
        observed (TechTarget Contributor, 2021). For qubits, this means that it can be both a 0 and a 
        1 at the same time until measured by the quantum gate, once observed, its quantum state 
        will instantly collapse to either the 1 or 0. The ability for a qubit to be in both states of 0 and 
        1 simultaneously means they can explore all possible solutions to a problem at the same 
        time, whereas bits have to go through each solution one by one (Linkedin.com, 2023). 
        Therefore, qubits allow quantum computers to solve problems millions of times faster than 
        classical computers. According to the research (Marr, 2021), Google announced it has a 
        quantum computer that is 100 million times faster than any classical computer in its lab.
        
        Quantum entanglement is a strange phenomenon that describes how two subatomic 
        particles are linked even if millions of light years apart (Emspak and Hickok, 2022). Qubits 
        are in a state of superposition before being measured, so they’re both 1 and 0 at the same 
        time. Having two entangled qubits, for example, q1 and q2, means that if we measure the 
        state of q1 to be 0, we know for definite that the state of q2 will be 1, without needing to 
        measure q2 (Madali Nabil, 2023). When two qubits are entangled, it also means that 
        changing the state of one qubit will instantaneously change the state of the other in a 
        predictable way, even if over very long distances (Giles, 2019). In a classical computer, 
        doubling the number of bits will double its processing power, but with quantum computers, 
        due to entanglement, slightly increasing the number of entangled qubits will exponentially 
        increase its processing speed (Giles, 2019).

        A quantum computer is made up of many complex and small parts but, can be broken down 
        into different sections. There is a classical computer section (Versluis, 2020) which will be 
        used to control and manage the quantum operations, carry out quantum algorithms then 
        process the final results. Then there is the cryogenic system (Dargan, 2023), which is used to 
        cool the quantum hardware down to nearly 0K or -273.15°C. The cryogenic system is 
        necessary as quantum computers require low operating temperatures due to the 
        problem qubits face called decoherence, caused by the interaction of qubits with their surrounding 
        environment (Dargan, 2023). By cooling them to near 0K, the vibrations that cause qubits to 
        lose their information are minimised (Dargan, 2023). Next, you have the quantum 
        components, such as the quantum software which is very specialised software needed to 
        run quantum algorithms. The quantum register (AIMultiple, 2023) which is a collection of 
        qubits that work together to perform algorithms.  Quantum gates (Universal Quantum, 2022), 
        which are the equivalent of logic gates in a classical computer, are responsible for 
        manipulating qubits to perform quantum operations. These gates can entangle and change 
        the state of qubits. Finally, there is a quantum processing unit (AIMultiple, 2023) which is like 
        a CPU in a classical computer except it relies on quantum principles to perform tasks. There 
        are many more intricate parts to a quantum computer too.

      Quantum computers are used to solve problems which are too complex for classical 
      computers to solve (Ibm.com, 2023) as they would take far too long. For example, evaluating 
      complex chemical reactions and molecular modelling, cryptography i.e., cracking codes 
      which would take a very long time and would be impractical with a classical computer, 
      predicting weather, simulating the behaviour of matter (Giles, 2019) and many other 
      applications. 
        
      Several companies have quantum computers, with large companies such as Microsoft, 
      Google, IBM, Amazon, Intel, Volkswagen, and Airbus and also less well-known, companies 
      such as D-Wave Systems, Atos, Quantinuum and others all use quantum computers for 
      machine learning and problem-solving.
        
      But what are the downsides to quantum computers? Why can’t the public use them? Well, 
      the obvious downside is the cost, as according to Quantum Zeitgeist (2023) a quantum 
      computer can cost anywhere from $10 to $50 million depending on its capabilities, which is 
      far too expensive for any single person to own. Another issue is that although quantum 
      computers clearly excel in various tasks like problem-solving and machine learning, they are 
      limited to only those and cannot be used for everyday tasks like a quick Google search as it 
      would be inefficient and impractical, which is where a classical computer would outperform 
      one and require much less resources (Gondek, 2023). There’s also the problem of 
      decoherence with qubits due to vibrations, temperature changes or electromagnetic waves 
      from the surrounding environment interfering with the qubits (Scott Pakin, Patrick Coles, 2019) 
      causing them to lose their information as they’re very fragile, so even the smallest 
      changes can cause them to break down. A solution is to keep the system at 0K but this can 
      be costly. 
      
      Quantum computers are still in the experimental phase and still need much more research 
      and development, and we definitely won’t be able to walk into a shop and buy one for the 
      foreseeable future, but with how fast technology evolves, it won't be long till we can fully 
      utilise them.
